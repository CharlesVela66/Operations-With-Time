We used the concepts of operator overloading to improve our Diagnostic File.
The implementations are the following:
-Sum of Time objects
-Substraction of Time objects
-Product of Time objects
-Divison of Time objects

We implemented 3 more operator overloading methods, but instead of being arithmetic, they are
logical. So we compare two Time Objects to determine:
-If a Time object is bigger than the other one
-If a Time object is smaller than the other one
-If 2 Time objects are equal.

PS: The implementations were made in the Time Class because that will be easier for the program to
know that the Time Objects are the one that have those specific methods.s
